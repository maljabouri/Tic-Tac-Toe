# User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

# Build Process

I started off setting up my HTML elements to display my game on screen. I then began writing my Javascript with the user stories in mind. I started with simple event listeners to fill my grid. Moved on to alternating turns, and checking for win and draw conditions. 

Unfortunately I was not able to implement the last 2 user stories into my project. 

# Improvements

First of all I'd like to have the last 2 user stories implemented. 

Going past that features i'd like to include are: 

- Score Tracker
- Audio
- Compatibility with other devices
- Potentially an AI to play against
